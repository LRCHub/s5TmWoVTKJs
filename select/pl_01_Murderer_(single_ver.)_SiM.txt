she's a murderer,
nobody knows the truth
is she a murderer? nobody knows
one day she went to a park
and found a hole
hole to core of the earth,
"I've seen
nothing like it before!"
but people ignored and
reviled her that she's a bore
they left her alone
and locked the door
she made a little bridge
with waste wood
to help 'em from deep hole
people thank her that
"without this bridge,
we can't even get to the mall"
but another day it collapsed by
fat guy and he fell into hole
TV's guess is
"she did it on purpose,
she's a murderer"
is she a murderer?
is she a murderer?
nobody knows the truth
is she a murderer?
is she a murderer?
is she a murderer?
here's another story
＜♪＞
one day she drove home
in the rain
she didn't drink even a drop,
she's not insane
when she turned left
at the corner,
a little shadow
appeared in front of her
then she steered to the right
to save the boy
but this choice
caused that mishap
she hit a man who was walking
on the other side of the street
with her van
you know she can't stop the time
TV's guess is "maybe she was
a drunk behind the wheel
and drove too fast,
she's a murderer"
is she a murderer?
is she a murderer?
nobody knows the truth
she's a murderer
is she a murderer?
is she a murderer?
nobody knows, oh-oh
＜♪＞
it's out of my sight
and out of device,
life is made with lies and vice
hold it tight, our sacrifice,
knife is made with broken dice
he lies, she lies
and everyone lies
he lies, she lies
and everyone lies
where is the truth?
where is the rule
now is the time to break through
this is why she killed her self
this is why she died
this is why she killed her self
this is why she died
WHO IS THE MURDERER?
WHO IS THE MURDERER?
WHO IS THE MURDERER?
nobody knows, oh-oh
