ONE CROWN
SHINES ON THROUGH THE SOUND
ONE CROWN
BORN TO LOSE
ONE MAN
DOES NOT GIVE A DAWN
ONE MAN
NO EXCUSE
ACES WILD
ACES HIGH
ALL THE ACES
ACES 'TIL YOU DIE
WHITE LINES FADING
THE IRON HORSE ROLLS ON AND ON AND ON
HEAR YOUR THUNDER
STILL FEEDING BACK
STILL HEAR YOUR THUNDER
THE MAN IN BLACK
BORN TO LOSE
LIVING TO WIN
ONE FIST
HAMMERS THROUGH THE MIST
ONE FIST
STEADY ON
ONE HEART
DIE HARD FROM THE START
ONE HEART
BEATS ITS SONG
MURDER ALL
MURDER ONE
GIMME MURDER
SECOND CLASS TO NONE
HEADLIGHTS FADING
THE IRON HORSE ROLLS ON AND ON AND ON
HEAR YOUR THUNDER
STILL FEEDING BACK
STILL HEAR YOUR THUNDER
THE MAN IN BLACK
BORN TO LOSE
LIVING TO WIN
HEAR YOUR THUNDER
STILL FEEDING BACK
STILL HEAR YOUR THUNDER
THE MAN IN BLACK
BORN TO LOSE
NO EXCUSE
TILL THE END
BEEN LIVING TO WIN
BEEN LIVING TO WIN
